Hash table is the optimization here.

To check if an element is in hash table key, we can do in O(1) by checking if ```dict[key]``` gives an error, as accessing an element is O(1) for hash tables.
In python, ```dict.keys()``` creates the whole list of keys, so it is an O(N) operation, while ```key in dict``` is an O(1) operation.

"
The ```in``` operator, like most other operators, is just a call to a ```__contains__``` method (or the equivalent for a C/Java/.NET/RPython builtin). list implements it by iterating the list and comparing each element; dict implements it by hashing the value and looking up the hash; blist.blist implements it by walking a B+Tree; etc. So, it could be O(n), O(1), O(log n), or something completely different.
